# tiy-final-project

## Description

I've decided I want to make an app that will help autocrossers keep track of their tire usage throughout the year. 
I've always had a tough time remembering the amount of runs that I've put on a set of tires and how long they lasted. 
As a racer I'd like to an easy way to keep track of this info, along with when the tires began to fall off, what surfaces
they were used on, and what car. I think having this information in a central place where other racers can see your data 
and share theirs would be great. I hope this project does that and is a useful tool.
